# CORS

- CORS:- Cross Origin Resource Sharing

* It is a HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.
* The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard works by adding new HTTP headers that let servers describe which origins are permitted to read that information from a web browser.
